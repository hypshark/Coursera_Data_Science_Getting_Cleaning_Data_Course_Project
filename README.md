Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment- Wearable Computing

This Repo contains the R Script, Tidy .txt file, and other necessary information to meet the requirements of Coursera/ Data Science/ JHU/ Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

The R Script does the following:
1. Downloads dataset into working directory (note: an optional "commented out" piece of code from lecture is included to set "./data" into directory.
2. Loads Activity and Feature Information
3. Loads Training and Testing information, then keeps only the data in regards to 'Mean' and 'Standard Deviation'
4. Loads the Activity and Subject information, then merges the columns with the dataset
5. Merges both primary datasets
6. Creates a 'tidy' dataset of mean values per variable.
7. Submission requirement: we then write a .txt file within R to submit.
